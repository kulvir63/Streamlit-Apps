# IRIS DATA PREDICTION APP 

I have made an application that predicts the species of an iris flower based on its physical characteristics. The app is built and deployed using Streamlit. The requirements file contains the requirements that should be fulfilled while running the app.py file if the user wants to run it on their device. 

## Dataset

The Iris dataset from the sklearn datasets is used to train the model. The dataset contains 150 iris flowersüèµÔ∏è, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The flowers are classified into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

## Usage

Once the app is running, one can set the physical characteristics of an iris flower using the slider and on the other side it will automatically predict the species of the iris flower.
